This may mean that small-scale ballooning instability leads to a smoothing of the radial plasma profile. The critical beta values for the real magnetic field of the gas-dynamic trap and various plasma pressure radial profiles was also calculated. For a plasma with a parabolic profile critical beta is evaluated at the level of 0.72. A previous theoretical prediction for this trap was almost two times lower than maximal beta 0.6 achieved experimentally.}

Usually, it is not measured data that are used, but parametrizations of the cross-section as a function of the ion energy and parametrizations of the Maxwellian reactivity as a function of the ion-temperature. Since the publication of the parametrizations now in use, new measurements have been made and evaluations of the measured data have been improved by applying R-matrix theory. The authors show that the old parametrizations no longer adequately represent the experimental data and present new parametrizations based on R-matrix calculations for fusion cross-sections and Maxwellian reactivities for the reactions D(d,n)3He, D(d,p)T, T(d,n)4He and 3He(d,p)4He}

A Fokker–Planck model named fast beam ion solver (FBIS) is developed to include the spatial non-uniformity of a physical mirror geometry. The mathematical framework allows for efficient orbit averaging of the pitch-angle scattering operator, and permits a determination of the axial profile of the ambipolar potential confining the electrons. The numerical results from FBIS are consistent with earlier work, but further show how mirror-ratio and a near square magnetic well optimizes the fusion gain. The numerical results are also applied to inform the conceptual design of WHAM++, a low capital-cost breakeven-class magnetic mirror device.}

    title = {Mirror Advanced Reactor Study (MARS): executive summary and overview},
    author = {Logan, B G and Perkins, L J and Gordon, J D},
    abstractNote = {Two self-consistent MARS configurations are discussed - a 1200-MWe commercial electricity-generating plant and a synguels-generating plant that produces hydrogen with an energy equivalent to 26,000 barrels of oil per day. The MARS machine emphasizes the attractive features of the tandem mirror concept, including steady-state operation, a small-diameter high-beta plasma, a linear central cell with simple low-maintenance blankets, low first-wall heat fluxes (<10 W/cm/sup 2/), no driven plasma currents or associated disruptions, natural halo impurity diversion, and direct conversion of end-loss charged-particle power. The MARS electric plant produces 2600 MW of fusion power in a 130-m-long central cell. Advanced tandem-mirror plasma-engineering concepts, a high-efficiency liquid lithium-lead (Li/sub 17/Pb/sub 83/) blanket, and efficient direct electrical conversion of end loss power combine to produce a high net plant efficiency of 36\%. With a total capital cost of $2.9 billion (constant 1983 dollars), the MARS electric plant produces busbar electricity at approx. 7 cents/kW-hour. The MARS synfuels plant produces 3500 MW of fusion power in a 150-m-long central cell. A helium-gas-cooled silicon carbide pebble-bed blanket provides high-temperature (1000/sup 0/C) heat to a thermochemical water-splitting cycle and the resulting hydrogen is catalytically converted to methanol for distribution. With a total capital cost of $3.6 billion (constant 1983 dollars), the synfuels plant produces methanol fuel at about \$1.7/gal. The major features of the MARS reactor include sloshing-ion thermal barrier plugs for efficient plasma confinement, a high efficiency blanket, high-field (24-T) choke cells, drift pumping for trapped plasma species, quasi-optical electron-cyclotron resonant heating (ECRH) systems, and a component gridless direct converter.},

    title = {The magnetic mirror approach to fusion},
    journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
    abstract = {The magnetic mirror approach to fusion is reviewed in depth. Starting with a brief chronological history of the development of the basic mirror concept, its subsequent evolution into the tandem mirror, the field reversed mirror and other variants is described. Also discussed are the many-faceted aspects of mirror theory, including adiabatic invariants, MHD equilibrium and stability, collisional processes, transport theory and micro-instability theory. The review concludes with an updating of experimental results, a discussion of mirror-related technology, including neutral beam injection and direct conversion, and a brief description of design studies of mirror fusion power plants.}
